Based in [AWS AppSync & Amplify with React & GraphQL - Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-appsync-amplify-with-react-graphql-course/?couponCode=OF53124)

The course is really outdated, it could be taken as a guide but there are many issues in the tutorial.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
